                <h2>Joe Thinks That Canada is Actually China</h2>
                <p>The year 2023 started off well with a lovely moment from Mr.Biden.
                    While in Canadian parliment Joe was asked a question and he responded
                    by confusing the country he is in, with China.

                <h2>It's Okay, Walking is Hard Joe</h2>
                <p>A few months later Joe was giving a speech at the US Airforce Academy
                    and when trying to leave the stage, his feet didnt seem to be working.

                <p>Well he has the name Sleepy Joe for a reason. Earlier this year Joe
                    was attending the Maui Memorial and the Media caught him resting his eyes.

                <h2>Okay, that's enough Joe</h2>
                <p>Unfortunately Joe's team wasn't the biggest fans of Joe going off script
                    this time. Joe was in the middle of a sentence when he was cut off by his
                    team.

                <p>It's not new news that Joe has trouble with his speech, but this time he
                    was having trouble reading the words right in front of him.
